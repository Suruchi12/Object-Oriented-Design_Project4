-The Remote Code Publisher makes a "ServersRepository" (in the x64 folder)that stores the files
 sent by the clients.
 -ServersRepository is where the created html files are stored once publish command is processed
 -When the Server sends the converted files back to the client, it is stored in a folder call ClientRepository
 -The project can upload, publish and download the files from the folder TestFiles
